# About PixArt!

Created by Team PixArt [Patrick Sullivan](https://github.com/patrick-j-sulley), [Oscar Holt](https://github.com/oscarholt), [Gordon Fong](https://github.com/gordon-fong), and [Kang Gao](https://github.com/gawk2333) for the one of many 1 day group projects within the web development bootcamp at Enspiral Dev Academy.

PixArt is an art web app that allows the user to draw up a pixel board where they can change the colour of each pixel upon clicking on it.

Party Party was developed with a stack of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.JS, and Express.
